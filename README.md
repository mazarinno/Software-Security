- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a banking app that required a website with secure software practices. 

- What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

In identifying the software security vulnerabilities within Artemis Financial's site, I did particularly well in using the Maven Dependency check to find relevant issues that could be addressed by the client to keep their site up to date and following best practices. It is important to code securely since vulnerabilities in your code could allow those with malicious intent to easily manipulate your product. Software security adds a lot of value to a company's overall wellbeing since it upholds their reputation. 

- What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

When working through the process of vulnerability assessment, I found the links to each vulnerability included within Maven's Dependency check reports to be particularly helpful. 

- How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I approached the need to increase layers of security by added an encryption algorithm within Artemis Financial's site. In the future, to assess vulnerabilties and determine mitigation techniques, I would definitely run dependency checks like I have done and also make sure that the overall code is secure itself. 

- How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured the code was functional and secure through the creation of a security certificate, with which I could verify the 'https' status of Artemis Financial's site. After refactoringt he code, new vulnerabilities were checked for again with the dependency check reports. 

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The Spring and Maven frameworks were something that I found interesting as I have not utilized them before. 

- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I may want to showcase my use of security certificates and encryption algorithms from this assignment as examples of software security that I have learned from this course.
